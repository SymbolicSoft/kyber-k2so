[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/symbolicsoft/kyber-k2so)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/symbolicsoft/kyber-k2so)

**Kyber-K2SO** is a clean implementation of the [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber) IND-CCA2-secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), whose security is based on the hardness of solving the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem over module lattices. Kyber is one of the candidate algorithms submitted to the [NIST post-quantum cryptography project](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography).

Kyber-K2SO implements only Kyber-768, and does not provide Kyber-512, Kyber-1024, or the _"90s Kyber"_ variants, because there does not appear to be a convincing reason to ever do so.

## Security Disclaimer
游뚿 This library is offered as-is, and without a guarantee. Therefore, it is expected that changes in the code, repository, and API occur in the future. It is recommended to take caution before using this library in a production application since part of its content is experimental.

# Features & Usage
Keeping in mind the Security Disclaimer above, Kyber-K2SO appears to be appropriate for use in any environment supported by Go: client-side application, server-side applications and more. All operations take no more than a few milliseconds on regular computing hardware.

## Features

* 游릭 **Purely functional, easy to read code.** Code readability and predictability is prioritized over performance.
* 游릭 **Smallest codebase.** Kyber-K2SO is to our knowledge the smallest implementation of Kyber Version 2, and is 4.3 times smaller than the reference implementation.
* 游릭 **Simple API.** `KemKeypair()` to generate a private key and a public key, `KemEncrypt(publicKey)` generate and encrypt a shared secret, and `KemDecrypt(ciphertext, privateKey)` to decrypt the shared secret.
* 游릭 **Good performance.** Kyber-K2SO is more than fast enough for regular usage in any environment supported by the Go programming language.
* 游릭 **Constant time (probably).** As far as we can tell, decryption appears to perform in constant time. Further analysis is encouraged.

## Using Kyber-K2SO
```bash
go get -u github.com/symbolicsoft/kyber-k2so
```

```go
privateKeyB, publicKeyB, _ := KemKeypair()
ciphertextA, sharedSecretA, _ := KemEncrypt(publicKeyB)
sharedSecretB, _ := KemDecrypt(ciphertextA, privateKeyB)
```

Yes, it's that simple!
